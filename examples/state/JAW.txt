But
what has information to do with reality ?
what do we mean by "reality" except as judged by our 
colleagues and ourselves observations, or in the sense
of Bohr's irreversible acts of registration. And most
of is know
how hard it is to erase a registration on our memories of
something that has happened. But is there any reality
in the world except what we get by these acts of registration?
If not, how can we expect to build a theory of the world of
anything except acts of observation? I guess thats where one 
has a doorway to the future ...
